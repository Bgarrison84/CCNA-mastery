​System Role: You are a Staff Full-Stack Developer and EdTech Instructional Designer. Your goal is to architect a high-fidelity, offline-first CCNA gamified learning app.
​Task: Provide a technical architecture, JSON schema, and a functional "Core Engine" prototype.
​Technical Stack & Constraints:
​Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JS (ES6+ Modules).
​Persistence: A unified GameState object synced to localStorage.
​Architecture: Use a State Pattern for the CLI and a Pub/Sub or Observer pattern for the Game Loop (to trigger XP/Level updates across UI components).
​Core Module Requirements:
​State Management: Create a robust Store class that handles XP, Level, Inventory (e.g., "Console Cable", "Packet Sniffer"), and CompletedLabs.
​The CLI Engine: Implement a class-based terminal simulation. It must support:
​Context-aware prompts: Router>, Router#, Router(config)#.
​A validate() method to compare the current running-config against a targetConfig JSON object.
​JSON Content Schema: Provide a schema that supports multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, and CLI-based "Boss Battles," including a source_ref field for Jeremy’s IT Lab or Official Cert Guide (OCG) citations.
​The Subnetting Logic: A JS utility function that generates a random IP/CIDR and returns an object containing the valid Network ID, Broadcast, and First/Last Usable for validation.
​Output Deliverables:
​File Structure: A clean, modular directory layout.
​The JSON Schema: A sample entry for a CLI Lab and a Quiz Question.
​The Boilerplate: Provide the core Terminal class and the GameState controller.
​Implementation Guide: A brief explanation of how to scale the "6-week narrative" without bloating the index.html.

## Planned Improvements Backlog
Work through these one by one in upcoming sessions. Full notes in memory: improvements_backlog.md

### High Impact / Straightforward
1. [ ] Exam Simulator Mode — timed 120Q session, proportional domain weighting, score by domain
2. [ ] Weak Area Dashboard — accuracy % by domain/week surfaced from QuizEngine result history
3. [ ] Wrong Answer Re-queue — missed questions re-enter session pool before quiz ends
4. [ ] `show access-lists` + ACL rendering in `show running-config` — Terminal.js gap, breaks ACL labs

### Content Gaps
5. [x] Story/Tutorial coverage — 16 new beats added 2026-03-23 covering TCP/UDP, ports, MAC tables, IPv6, topologies, inter-VLAN (ROAS), STP deep-dive, EtherChannel, wireless (CAPWAP/WLC), FHRP/HSRP, DNS, SNMP, threats taxonomy, AAA/TACACS+/RADIUS, IPsec VPN, and Ansible vs Puppet/Chef
6. [ ] Drag-and-Drop Expansion — only 11 exist; good for OSI ordering, OSPF states, TCP handshake
6. [ ] Multi-Part Scenario Questions — scenario paragraph + 3-4 linked questions; needs `scenario_ref` schema field
7. [ ] Subnetting Practice Mode — expose Subnetting.js as standalone rapid-fire drill with streak counter

### Engine / Technical
8. [x] Named ACL Mode — `ip access-list extended NAME` → ACL_CONFIG mode with permit/deny subcommands; named ACLs render as blocks in running-config (added 2026-03-23)
9. [x] Multi-Device Lab Support — `devices{}` wrapper in lab config, device-switcher UI, `switchDevice()` API, `_validateSingle()` per-device; unlocks OSPF neighbor lab lab_w3_ospf_neighbor (added 2026-03-23)
10. [x] Port Security Commands — `switchport port-security [maximum|mac-address sticky|violation]` fully implemented; validate() checks portSecurity; lab_w5_port_security added (added 2026-03-23)

### Engagement / Retention
11. [x] Daily Streak + Bonus XP — `store.checkStreak()` on init; streak 3+=1.25x, 7+=1.5x XP; multiplier applied in QuizEngine.answer(); HUD shows streak + multiplier badge; streak toast on extend (added 2026-03-23)
12. [x] Mistake Notebook — `store.recordMistake(id)` in submitQuizAnswer(); `getMistakeIds(2)` thresholds; Notebook view with drill mode reusing QuizEngine; nav button added (added 2026-03-23)
13. [x] Boss Battle Scaling — questions sorted easy→medium→hard via `_sortByDifficulty()`; damage scales 10/20/30 HP by phase; phase banner UI on phase transition; perfect-run bonus +100 XP; perfect-run shown on end screen (added 2026-03-23)

## Phase 5 Backlog (recommended 2026-03-23 — work through in order, one per session)
Full notes in memory: improvements_backlog.md

1. [x] **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)** — `reviewSchedule{}` in Store; intervals [1,3,7,14,30,90,180] days; `updateSRS()`, `getSRSState()`, `getSRSStats()`, `clearSRS()`; QuizEngine `srs:true` sorts pool by dueDate; SRS stats bar + SRS toggle in Grind view; NEW/DUE/LEARNING/MASTERED badge on each question; "caught up" screen when nothing due (added 2026-03-23)
2. [x] **Multi-Select Questions** — Checkbox UI in quiz + exam renderers; submit button activated on first check; `_revealMultiSelect()` green/red/yellow reveal; 21 new questions added across all 6 domains (added 2026-03-23)
3. [x] **Keyboard Shortcuts for Quiz** — 1–4 / A–D for MC and multi-select; T/F for true/false; Enter/Space to submit multi-select. Handler cleaned up on submit + nav. Hint text shown per question. Works in Grind + Exam. (added 2026-03-23)
4. [x] **More CLI Labs** — Terminal.js: DHCP_CONFIG mode, IPv6 (unicast-routing/address/route), HSRP standby, channel-group/Port-channel, STP vlan priority + portfast. 5 new labs added (28 total). (added 2026-03-23)
5. [x] **`interface vlan` / SVI Support** — `vlan → Vlan` alias; two-token `interface vlan N` fix; SVIs default shutdown=false; `ip routing` command + validation; VLAN validation. Lab: lab_svi_intervlan (29 labs total). (added 2026-03-23)
6. [x] **Drag-and-Drop Expansion** — 21 new questions (32 total). TCP teardown, ARP, OSI encap, CSMA/CD, full OSPF FSM, STP election + tiebreakers, EtherChannel, 802.1Q fields, LSA types, BGP FSM, subnetting, EIGRP DUAL, NAT PAT, DNS, SLAAC, 802.1X, troubleshooting, SDN, AD values, DR/BDR. (added 2026-03-23)
7. [x] **Study Timer** — `store.studyMinutes` + `addStudyTime()` + `studyHours` getter. `_viewEnterTime` flushed on every `switchView()`. Stats card: time studied, progress bar to 300hr goal, hrs remaining. (added 2026-03-23)
8. [x] **Question Flag System** — `store.toggleFlag/isFlagged/getFlaggedIds/clearFlags`. ⚐/⚑ button in quiz + exam. Notebook: flagged panel with drill, per-question unflag, clear-all. (added 2026-03-23)
9. [x] **True Offline Mode** — `css/tailwind.js` (398KB local copy). `sw.js`: cache-first + stale-while-revalidate, pre-caches all assets on install. `manifest.json` (PWA). SW registered in index.html. (added 2026-03-23)
10. [x] **Question Review on Summary Screen** — `_buildReviewDetail(q, userAnswer)` helper handles MC/true_false/multi_select/drag_drop with colour-coded options (green=correct, red=wrong pick, dim=missed). Quiz summary: expandable rows with ▶/▼ caret, max-h scroll. Exam summary: same expandable list below domain breakdown. Both use event delegation. (added 2026-03-23)

## Phase 6 Audit Findings (2026-03-23)
Full notes in memory: audit_findings.md

### Critical (in progress)
1. [x] **Deduplicate 18 question pairs** — 19 duplicate IDs removed from content.json (zero-day had 3 copies; 17 other pairs). Kept the higher-quality/domain-specific ID in each case. (done 2026-03-23)
2. [x] **Fix mislabeled lab_w4_dhcp** — was a basic interface/static-route/VTY lab with zero DHCP content. Renamed to `lab_w1_interface_route`, moved to Week 1, set easy/65 XP, fixed title/description/objectives/hints. `lab_dhcp_server` is the actual DHCP lab and is correct. (done 2026-03-23)
3. [x] **Hard question shortage** — target 25% ACHIEVED. Was 8% (269/3357). Added 757 questions across 10 batches → 25.0% (1026/4096). W1=25.0%, W2=25.2%, W3=25.8%, W4=25.2%, W5=25.6%, W6=26.1%. (done 2026-03-23)

### Medium (PAUSED — resuming next session)
4. [x] **Week 6 T/F imbalance** — Converted 12 of 18 T/F → MC. Kept 6 T/F (Ansible agentless, REST JSON/XML, NETCONF port 830, M365 SaaS, VM vs container, NFV≠SDN). W6 now: 426 MC / 6 T/F / 5 drag_drop / 3 multi_select. (done 2026-03-24)
5. [x] **Lab progression imbalance** — Added NAT support to Terminal.js (`ip nat inside/outside`, `ip nat pool`, `ip nat inside source list/static`). Added 3 W6 labs: `lab_w6_static_nat` (easy/95XP), `lab_w6_nat_pat` (medium/130XP), `lab_w6_enterprise_full` (hard/280XP). Week 6 now has 5 labs (was 2). (done 2026-03-24)
6. [x] **Dynamic domain dropdown** — `QuizEngine.DOMAINS` static getter replaced with `QuizEngine.domainsFrom(questions)` static method. Derives sorted unique domains from question bank at runtime. All 3 call sites in main.js updated (Grind filter, Stats domain totals init, Stats domain rows). New domains in content.json appear automatically. (done 2026-03-24)
7. [x] **WAN Technologies (55 legacy Qs)** — All 55 integrated: 39 NF→Week 1; 6 WAN/SD-WAN→IP Services Week 4; 4 cloud/virt→Automation Week 6; 6 wireless→Network Access Week 2. Week 0 is now empty. Totals: W1=1112, W2=829, W3=586, W4=652, W5=473, W6=444 (4096 total). (done 2026-03-24)

### Low (PAUSED — resuming next session)
8. [x] **Study timer flush order** — `_viewEnterTime` now set to `null` before render, then to `Date.now()` AFTER the render block. Eliminates race condition where render-triggered secondary `switchView` caused near-zero elapsed time to be discarded. Removed duplicate flush from `renderStats`. (done 2026-03-24)
9. [x] **Whitespace name validation** — prompt now loops until a non-blank name is entered or user cancels. Also triggers if playerName is falsy (null/""). Cancel keeps 'Network Cadet' default. (done 2026-03-24)
10. [x] **Inventory items are cosmetic** — All items now have mechanical effects: Console Cable → +2 hints on acquire; Packet Sniffer → +10% lab XP (passive); Subnet Calc Pro → shows /<cidr> = subnetMask in subnetting tool; Debug Badge → unlocks `debug` commands (already existed); CCNA Cert Frame → legendary cosmetic. Descriptions updated. (done 2026-03-24)
11. [x] **No Week 4 easy labs** — Added `lab_w4_ntp_syslog` (easy, 70 XP): hostname + Gi0/0 IP + enable secret + console/VTY lines. Week 4 now has 4 labs: easy/medium/medium/hard. (done 2026-03-24)
12. [x] **Exam time mismatch** — `EXAM_TIME_SECONDS` changed from 90*60 to 120*60. UI text updated to "120-minute timer". (done 2026-03-24)

## Phase 8 — Landing Page & UX Polish (planned 2026-03-25)
Full notes in memory: phase8_plan.md
Goal: give the project a public face, improve first-run experience, and make the app more visually engaging and easier to navigate.
Work through items in order, one per session. Ask before moving to next.

### Item 1 — Public Landing Page (`landing.html`)
New file at repo root served by GitHub Pages as the public entry point.
**Content sections:**
- Hero: app name, tagline ("Master the CCNA 200-301 — free, offline, gamified"), "Launch App →" CTA button linking to `index.html`
- Feature grid: one card per section (Story Mode, The Grind, CLI Labs, Exam Sim, Boss Battles, Subnetting, Flashcards, Reference Library) — icon + one-line description
- How it works: 3-step visual (Install PWA → Study daily → Track progress)
- CCNA Study Best Practices panel (see below)
- Tech/stats bar: "4,186 questions · 33 CLI labs · 6 boss battles · 100% offline"
- Footer: GitHub link, no-backend notice, Cisco disclaimer

**CCNA Study Best Practices to include on landing page:**
1. Follow the 6-week curriculum in order — builds on prior knowledge each week
2. Set a target exam date; work backwards to set a daily hours goal (300 hrs total recommended)
3. Do CLI labs every week — the real exam has simulation tasks; muscle memory matters
4. Use SRS daily — spaced repetition is the most evidence-based retention method
5. Practice subnetting until you can do /24–/30 splits in under 30 seconds
6. Take a full timed exam sim at the end of each week to measure readiness
7. Review every wrong answer before your next session — the Mistake Notebook auto-tracks these
8. Supplement with Jeremy's IT Lab (YouTube) or Cisco's Official Cert Guide for concepts
9. Join r/ccna — community context helps enormously when concepts don't click
10. Aim for 85%+ on practice exams before booking the real thing (820/1000 = pass)

**Visual style:** match the app's terminal/hacker aesthetic — dark background, green glows, monospace font, scanline overlay, typewriter headline animation.

### Item 2 — Onboarding / First-Run Tour
- On very first load (no localStorage), show a dismissable welcome modal: 3-slide carousel explaining Story Mode → Grind → Labs before prompting for callsign
- "Skip tour" link always visible
- Store a `onboardingDone` flag so it never shows again

### Item 3 — Animated Boot Sequence
- Replace the instant render with a 1.5s terminal boot sequence on first app load (not on return visits)
- Lines type out: `CCNA-MASTERY v1.0 ... LOADING CONTENT ... OK ... STARTING SESSION`
- Runs during the `fetch('./data/content.json')` await — hides latency, adds character
- Skippable with any keypress

### Item 4 — Visual Polish & Micro-Animations
- Floating "+XP" text animation that rises and fades when answering correctly (CSS keyframe, no lib)
- HP bar flash effect on boss battles (red pulse on damage)
- XP bar smooth fill animation already exists — add a brief glow pulse on level-up
- Correct answer: brief green border flash on the chosen option before revealing
- Wrong answer: brief red shake animation on the chosen option
- Card hover: subtle scale(1.01) + border glow on quiz option cards
- Stats radar chart: animate paths from center outward on render (CSS stroke-dashoffset)

### Item 5 — Loading / Error States
- Show a styled terminal loading screen while `content.json` fetches (replaces blank flash)
- If fetch fails, show a clear "OFFLINE — content failed to load" error with retry button instead of silently falling back to empty arrays
- Empty state screens for sections with no data (e.g., Grind before any sessions: "No quiz history yet — start your first session below")

### Item 6 — Navigation & Discoverability
- Keyboard shortcut `?` opens a cheat-sheet modal listing all keyboard shortcuts app-wide
- Breadcrumb / section subtitle in the top bar already shows current view — extend it to show context (e.g., "The Grind › Week 3 · IP Connectivity")
- "What's here?" tooltip/popover on each nav button (hover on desktop, long-press on mobile)
- Section landing pages: each view shows a brief one-liner about what it does and a "how to use" tip the first time it's visited

### Item 7 — Theming & Colour Unlock
- Add amber terminal theme (`--terminal-green: #ffb000`) unlocked at Level 5
- Add blue/cyan theme (`--terminal-green: #00bfff`) unlocked at Level 8
- Theme toggle in the sidebar footer or Stats screen settings
- Store theme in `store.state.settings.theme`; apply via CSS custom property swap on `<html>`

### Item 8 — Daily Challenge Card
- One featured question per day on the Story home screen (deterministic daily seed from date)
- Displayed as a compact "Daily Challenge" card above the weak-areas card
- Answering it grants +50 XP bonus; card greyed out for rest of day after completion
- Builds habit without requiring a full quiz session

### Item 9 — Print / Export Study Notes
- In the Notebook view: "Export Notebook" button downloads a formatted `.txt` or `.md` file listing all flagged questions + mistake questions with their correct answers and explanations
- Useful for offline paper review or sharing with study groups

### Item 10 — `index.html` → App; `landing.html` → Entry Point (routing)
- Rename current `index.html` → `app.html`; create new `index.html` as landing page
- GitHub Pages serves `index.html` by default → landing page is what visitors see first
- "Launch App" button on landing navigates to `app.html`
- Service worker and manifest point at `app.html` for PWA install
- 404.html redirect trick not needed since it's all static

### Item 11 — Visual Concept Diagrams & Deep-Dive Learning Mode
**Problem:** The app teaches through questions and quick-reference tables, but never *shows* concepts visually. A learner reading about OSI troubleshooting has no diagram to anchor it; the Reference section's OSI vs TCP/IP entry is a good cheat-sheet but not a teaching resource.

**Goal:** Add inline visual diagrams and deeper explanations so that concepts are shown, not just tested.

**Approach — two layers:**

1. **Inline concept panels in Story Mode beats** — when a beat introduces a topic (e.g., OSI model, subnetting, STP election), display a collapsible "📐 Concept Visual" block below the narrative containing an HTML/CSS diagram or ASCII art + a plain-English deeper explanation. No images needed — build diagrams from styled `<div>` and `<table>` elements (works offline).

2. **Expanded Reference entries** — each Reference section gets a "Deep Dive" toggle that reveals:
   - A rendered diagram (HTML/CSS, SVG inline, or styled table)
   - Step-by-step worked example
   - Common exam traps / misconceptions
   - Link to the relevant Story Mode beat or Grind drill

**Priority topics to build diagrams for (in order):**
- OSI model: 7-layer stack with PDU names, protocols per layer, encapsulation arrows; side-by-side TCP/IP comparison; troubleshooting flow (top-down vs bottom-up vs divide-and-conquer)
- Subnetting: visual bit-boundary diagram showing how a /26 carves a /24; worked example (network, broadcast, first/last host, next network)
- Ethernet frame: field-by-field visual with byte widths labelled
- STP: port state timeline (Blocking → Listening → Learning → Forwarding), root bridge election flowchart
- OSPF: neighbor state machine with triggering events on each arrow; LSA type table with scope illustrated
- TCP 3-way handshake and 4-way teardown: sequence diagram with flag labels
- NAT/PAT: before/after packet header diagram showing address translation
- VLAN/trunk: physical vs logical topology side-by-side showing tagged/untagged frames
- IPv6 address types: visual address space map (global unicast vs link-local vs multicast prefixes)
- ACL processing: flowchart showing top-down match logic with implicit deny

**Interactivity is a core design principle for all diagrams — not optional:**
- OSI model: click any layer → expands inline to show PDU name, real protocols, and a one-line "what happens here" explanation
- Subnetting diagram: user enters a CIDR → diagram redraws live showing the bit boundary, host count, and address range (ties into existing Subnetting.js engine)
- TCP handshake: step-through mode — user clicks "Next Step" to advance through SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK one at a time with each packet highlighted on the sequence diagram
- STP state machine: click any state (Blocking / Listening / Learning / Forwarding) → highlights valid transitions out, shows timer or trigger condition
- OSPF neighbor states: same step-through as TCP — advance through Down → Init → 2-Way → ExStart → Exchange → Loading → Full with event labels
- NAT/PAT diagram: toggle between "before translation" and "after translation" views, with the changing fields highlighted in amber
- VLAN/trunk: clickable ports — select a VLAN ID and watch which ports receive the frame (tagged vs untagged highlighted)
- ACL flowchart: paste in a sample ACL + source IP → the flowchart animates which rule matches and shows permit/deny outcome
- Traveling packet animation (SVG): a packet dot moves hop-by-hop along a topology path; click any device to inspect its routing table or ARP cache at that moment
- All interactive elements keyboard-accessible (Tab + Enter) for accessibility and for users without a mouse

**Implementation notes:**
- All diagrams built from HTML/CSS/SVG — zero external images, works 100% offline
- Interactive state managed in plain JS closures per diagram — no framework needed
- Diagrams live in a new `js/diagrams/` module, one file per topic (e.g., `diagrams/osi.js`, `diagrams/stp.js`)
- Each diagram module exports a `render(containerEl)` function that injects HTML/SVG and wires up its own event listeners
- Story Mode beat schema gains optional `concept_visual` field: `{ title, diagramId, explanation }` — `diagramId` maps to a diagrams module
- Reference section schema gains optional `deep_dive` field: `{ diagramId, worked_example, exam_traps }`

## Phase 9 — Expand Learning Depth (planned 2026-03-26)
Full notes in memory: project_phase9.md
Goal: interactivity audit + security training + cloud training + practical projects.

New `type: "project"` schema field; `store.completedProjects{}` for phase progress.

### Pillar 5 — Mega Labs
Large-scale, multi-concept, multi-phase CLI labs that simulate real enterprise scenarios end-to-end. Unlike Projects (which are guided with hints), Mega Labs are closer to exam simulations — minimal hand-holding, full topology, multiple devices, cross-domain objectives.

**Design principles:**
- Each Mega Lab spans 4–8 phases, each unlocking after the previous is validated
- Phase completion is checked by `validate()` on the relevant device(s); partial credit per phase
- Topology diagrams shown inline (HTML/CSS, no images) — user can see the full network before starting
- "Briefing" narrative: a scenario context (e.g. "You are the new network engineer at Acme Corp...") sets the stakes
- Hint system still available but heavily penalised (−30 XP per hint used)
- Completion awards a unique title/badge stored in `store.state.badges[]`
- Mega Labs are gated: appear locked until the player reaches a minimum level or completes prerequisite labs

**Implementation notes:**
- Mega Labs reuse `Terminal.js` multi-device engine (`devices{}` wrapper, `switchDevice()`)
- New `type: "megalab"` in content schema with fields: `phases[]`, `topology_html`, `briefing`, `min_level`, `prerequisite_labs[]`, `badge`
- Each phase: `{ id, title, objectives[], device, targetConfig{} }`  — validated independently
- `store.state.megaLabProgress: { [labId]: { phase: N, hintsUsed: N, startedAt, completedAt } }`
- New `renderMegaLabs()` view: dramatic card design, topology preview on hover, locked/unlocked state, badge showcase
- Phase stepper UI: numbered phases across the top; completed = green, active = amber, locked = grey
- Auto-save progress after each phase so the user can resume across sessions
